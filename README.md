# Ames-Real-Estate-Analysis
Analyzing real estate sales data from Ames, Iowa using regression analysis, feature extraction, and cluster analysis amongst other techniques.

## Data Cleansing (Python)
- Removed all columns that did not contain continuous numerical values
- Original dataset contained many N/A values, which were dealt with by filling with column averages

## PCA (R)
- Conducted a feature extraction technique known as Principal Component Analysis (PCA) Analysis to reduce complexity in the dataset. This was neccesary as the original data has a high number of dimensions (82 columns) and multicollinearity issues.
